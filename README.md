7. On Connect Wallet, you can use any set of emoji paths to connect to your wallet (for better use, just copy and paste the path you want to use. If inserted correctly, any path will successfully connect to your wallet)

8. Once your wallet is connected, the path you used and your wallet address will appear on screen

9. After wallet connection, use the Add Calendar Entry button to register an entry on the calendar by choosing a date. The calendar entry will appear on the Calendar Component and will be the Current Path used to connect to your MetaMask wallet.

OBS.: On a successfull connection to your MetaMask wallet, it's possible to create a signer or a provider to execute functions like sending crypto from one wallet to another, but that's not the scope of this demo.
